\section{Code Description}

I uploaded three text files to Google Colab from my Google Drive and read them using a for loop. I implemented a character count logic that adds 1 for each character falling within the ranges of (a to z) or (A to Z). Additionally, I incremented the word count by 1 for spaces (" ") or hyphens ("-"). For sentence count, I added 1 for each occurrence of ".", "?", or "!".

\section{Finding Readability index}

Finally, I computed the readability index by applying a given formula to the PDF. If the result was less than 0, then it will be shown as 0.
